    Steps that are not required but recommended are marked by the use of "(Optional)" markings at the start of the steps.

        Download the plugin and put the plugin in your plugins server folder and make sure that your server is Spigot 1.13 or greater and have any permission plugin (Example LuckPerms) installed.
        Restart the server.
        Configure the config.yml what you likes and do /hoh reload.
        Load the world/area where you want the game to start and do /hoh start 1/2/3..
        Join the teams and give them custom name!
        The game will automatically start when all player are in teams!
